# python_prac_repo
My python practice and notes to teach myself python. Much of this repo is based off of Harvard CS50 Python class.

Notes are made by me to myself as if I am teaching myself when reading them later. They are a mess and switch back and forth from first person to third inclusive etc., I hope you can get some value if you are reading them.
