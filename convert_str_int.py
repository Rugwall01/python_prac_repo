integer = 2024
name = 'Mario'
string_number = '22'

print(name + str(integer))
#integer is a numerical vlue and name is a string value. In order to print them together
#you need to define what you want to print as the "STING VALUE" of the integer. NOT the integer value
#itself (Basically you are converting the integer value into its corresponding string value 
#Do this by typing str to state that you want the string value of the next argument
#in this case it is integer, and so would follow str(integer) to get the "string value of integer"

print(10 + int(string_number))
#This does essentially the same thing in the opposite direction. It converts a number that exists as
#a string value into and integer value so it can be used together with another integer in the 
#print function
