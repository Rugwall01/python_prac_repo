# THIS IS A SIMPLE program that collects names, the point of this is that if this program were larger or more important we wouldnt want to have to re enter the data each time we run the program because the data is lost each time. Here we explore file input output or file I/O in which we will write/save information from the inputs to a file via the code in our program GO TO names2.py
