for i in range(3):

# Adding a function range to our for loop for the cat instead of listing each iteration I want it to go through in order to handle extreme cases as well as save time in almost all cases




# A STANDARD PYTHONIC CONVENTION FOR THIS IS BELOW

for _ in range(3):
    print("meow")


# If you need a variable just because the program or feature requires it to do some sort of process, but you don't care about that variable in any other context other than itsnecessity as a function of this program or feature, then you can use a single '_' in place of 'i', both are entirely correct however it is a convention to do it this way as a reminder to yourself later that its a variable that you don't care about its name or value as an output feature of the tool/program its just there to make a piece of it function. Other variables may output some "end data" or "end goal data" that was the intendedto be produced for some human purpose, this is distinct from the previous variable defined, which is only for the purpose of the programs function.
