# this is the most efficient version of the previuos code, I will modify it below the comment but
# put it here in the comments
# name = input("What's your name? ").strip().title()
# print(f"hello, {name}")


# Ask for name  
name = input("What's your name? ").strip().title()

# Split user's name into first name and last name
first, last = name.split(" ")


# Say hello to user as mosified by split, enter the piece of 'name' as defined in split mod in curly 
# braces to display that piece only 
print(f"hello, {name}")
